# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About Porject
As given in the Frontend Trainees Assignment Document *I have tried to replicate it to the best of my ability and tried to cover all the possible combinations of input if it one or two are left apologies* on the large screens as mobile responsive was not mentioned on the document so I solely focused on making the graphs and search everything work . *As the second row was no graph available in the screenshots so I took the liberty and if add widget button is clicked it will create pie graph in that row.*
# Add Widget button:-
It is according to the row whichever row you click in the add widget will create a widget of that particular Type.
